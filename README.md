### Setting up OpenBCI GUI with Cyton 32-bit 8 chan. (Windows 10)

2.	Please place the OpenBCIHub in your Program Files directory such that the structure looks like: “\Program Files\OpenBCIHub\OpenBCIHub.exe”



3. Enter the new OpenBCIHub folder and right click on the executable -> properties -> compatibility -> tick “Run this program as an administrator”.

4.	Create a short cut on your desktop by right click on the executable -> Send to -> Desktop

5.	Then double click the executable to run it for the first time. You must check both check boxes when prompted.

6.	We recommend you leave the Hub running, even when not using the OpenBCI_GUI, the hub’s impact on performance when not in use is minimal.

7.	Verify the hub is running in your windows tool tray.

8.	To quit the hub, click the OpenBCI icon, and then press the quit button.

9.	Please place the GUI in your Program Files directory such that the structure looks like: “\Program Files\OpenBCI_GUI\OpenBCI_GUI.exe”

10. If you already have a GUI installed, you may select to replace all the files

11. Replacing the files may bring up another pop up that you need to accept for altering files within the Program Files folder.

12.	Lastly, right click on the executable -> properties -> compatibility -> tick “Run this program as an administrator”.
