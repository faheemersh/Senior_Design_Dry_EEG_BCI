### This branch includes the required files to successfully stream data into MATLAB directly from the serial port, though with some caveats.

### The guide below shows how to use the files in this branch. 

1.	Download the atom2626.m, int24_to_int32.m, unpack_openbci_eeg.m from this branch, all to the same directory. Note that if you click on each of the files, there are comments showing updates to those files. Make sure to modify them accordingly. If there are no comments, assume that those files don’t need modification.
2.	Run the OpenBCI Hub program. Note that you do not need to do this for any of the other methods above. Make sure it is running by checking the taskbar icons (bottom right in the picture below).

3.	Plug in the dongle and turn on the Cyton board. 
4.	Open atom2626.m. Change line 2 so that it shows which port you’ll be streaming from. If you scroll down to line 27, you can change the number of samples to record for each channel. Once that is done, run the file. If you get the following error: “Open failed: Cannot connect to the COM13 port. Possible reasons are another application is connected to the port or the port does not exist.”, then you need to close Matlab, open the script, and run again. Note that it might take a couple of tries for this to work, without any errors. If it works properly, you will see ans = 0 as the only thing in the command window after >>atom2626.
5.	In your workspace, there should be a variable called eeg_data. Double click it to open. If your data looks similar to the data below, then you have successfully streamed data directly from the serial port to Matlab. NOTE: To run the script again, you MUST close Matlab and reopen it. Only then will the script work. Still looking for a work around.
