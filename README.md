### This branch contains the online code for both types of classifiers developed. Remember to add the path containing CSP.m, spatFilt.m, CursorMovement.m, and WinOnTop.m. Run the cursor control application in a separate instance of MATLAB prior to running the online code, as per the instructions on the Online Prediction Wiki page.

CSP.m and spatFilt.m are borrowed from research, though the group wrote its own code for CSP as well: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/895946/
